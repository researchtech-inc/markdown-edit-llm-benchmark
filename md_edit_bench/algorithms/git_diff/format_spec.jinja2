## Unified Diff Format

The diff format uses:
- `---` and `+++` lines to indicate the original and modified file
- `@@ -start,count +start,count @@` hunk headers (line numbers are hints, context lines matter more)
- Lines starting with `-` are removed from original
- Lines starting with `+` are added in the new version
- Lines starting with ` ` (space) are context (unchanged)

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Use exact line content**: The `-` lines and context lines MUST match the EXACT text from the original document, character-for-character. Copy-paste, do not paraphrase.

2. **Include context**: Each hunk should include 2-3 lines of unchanged context before and after changes.

3. **Preserve line structure**: If a paragraph is on ONE line in original, keep it on ONE line in replacement. Each line in original must match exactly to a line in your diff.

4. **Context lines need space prefix**: Every unchanged line MUST start with ` ` (space).

5. **Blank lines matter**: Show blank lines as ` ` (space only) - they are part of document structure.

6. **Small focused hunks**: Make multiple small hunks rather than one large hunk for changes in different parts.

7. **Replacing vs Adding**: To MODIFY text, use `-` and `+`. To only ADD, use only `+` lines.

Note: Original is ONE line, replacement is ONE line (even if long).
