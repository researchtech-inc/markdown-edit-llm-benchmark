You are an expert document editor. Given a document and requested changes, write only the edited sections of the document with all changes applied.

<original_document>
{{ initial }}
</original_document>

<requested_changes>
{{ changes }}
</requested_changes>

When outputting the edited document:
- For every unchanged sections, write only the first and last line of the section with `...` in between instead of unchanged lines
- Line before and after `...` must be EXACT copies from the original
- Output the complete document structure (not just changed sections)
