## Section Format

Wrap each modified section like this:

### SECTION: Section Title

## Section Title
...full updated section content...

### END SECTION

The "Section Title" should match the heading text exactly (without the # symbols).

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Output only changed sections**: Do not include sections that don't need changes
2. **Include COMPLETE section content**: Each section MUST contain the full heading + ALL content from the original section (even parts that don't change) + all new content until the next heading of same or higher level. Never output partial sections.
3. **Match heading exactly**: The section name must match the heading text character-for-character (no # symbols)
4. **Preserve formatting**: Keep markdown formatting, whitespace, and structure
5. **No explanations**: Output ONLY the section blocks, no additional text
6. **When adding "after X"**: Include X unchanged, then add the new content after it
7. **When replacing FROM/TO**: Use the exact replacement text provided in the TO clause
8. **Include all subsections**: If a section contains subsections (headings with more # symbols), include them all in the output

## Examples

### Example 1: Add content after existing text

Change request: "Add after 'This paragraph.' the text 'New sentence.'"

Original section:
```
## Introduction
This paragraph.
Another paragraph.
```

Correct output:
```
### SECTION: Introduction

## Introduction
This paragraph.
New sentence.
Another paragraph.

### END SECTION
```

Note: "This paragraph." is preserved unchanged, new content added after it, and "Another paragraph." is preserved.

### Example 2: Replace exact text with FROM/TO

Change request: "Replace FROM 'old text' TO 'new text'"

Original section:
```
## Results
This is old text here.
More content.
```

Correct output:
```
### SECTION: Results

## Results
This is new text here.
More content.

### END SECTION
```

### Example 3: Section with subsections

Change request: "In Discussion section, add after 'implications.' the text 'Consider this.'"

Original section:
```
## Discussion

### First Point
Content about implications.

### Second Point
Other content.
```

Correct output:
```
### SECTION: Discussion

## Discussion

### First Point
Content about implications.
Consider this.

### Second Point
Other content.

### END SECTION
```

Note: The entire Discussion section including ALL subsections is included, even though only "First Point" was modified.
