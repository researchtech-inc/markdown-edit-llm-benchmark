Output ONLY the edited regions, not the whole document.

FORMAT:
- // prefix = unchanged line from original (context/anchor)
- No prefix = NEW or CHANGED content (the actual edit)
- // alone = blank line from original

CRITICAL: Your output MUST contain lines WITHOUT // prefix - those are the actual changes!

EXAMPLE - Adding text:

Original document:
## Section A

Old content here.

## Section B

Edit: Add "New line." after "Old content here."

Correct output:
// Old content here.

New line.

// ## Section B

EXAMPLE - Replacing text:

Original document:
## Results

Bad number.

## End

Edit: Change "Bad number." to "Good number."

Correct output:
// ## Results
//
Good number.
//
// ## End

EXAMPLE - Deleting text:

Original document:
Keep this.

Delete this.

Keep this too.

Edit: Delete "Delete this."

Correct output:
// Keep this.
//
// Keep this too.

WRONG - Do NOT output the entire document with // on every line. Only output the small regions being edited with a few lines of context.
