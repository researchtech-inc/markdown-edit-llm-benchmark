## SEARCH/REPLACE Format

Use this format for each change:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
exact text to find
=======
replacement text
>>>>>>> REPLACE

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **SEARCH text must match closely**: Copy text from the original document as accurately as possible. The system uses fuzzy matching and can handle minor whitespace differences.

2. **One block per change**: Use separate SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for changes in different parts of the document.

3. **Include context**: The SEARCH text should include 1-2 lines before and after the text being changed to ensure unique matching.

4. **For additions**: Include the line(s) before where you want to add content in SEARCH, then include those same lines PLUS the new content in REPLACE.

5. **For deletions**: Include the text to delete in SEARCH, and omit it from REPLACE (keeping surrounding context).

## Example

To add a paragraph after "## Introduction":

<<<<<<< SEARCH
## Introduction

This is the first paragraph.
=======
## Introduction

This is the first paragraph.

This is a new paragraph being added.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
