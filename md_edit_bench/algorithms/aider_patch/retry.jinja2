The following patch sections failed to match the current document state.
The document has been partially modified by earlier sections. Please provide corrected sections
that will match the CURRENT document state shown below.

<current_document>
{{ current }}
</current_document>

<failed_sections>
{{ failed_sections }}
</failed_sections>

For each failed section, output a corrected patch section where the context and deletion lines
match the CURRENT document (not the original). The addition/replacement lines should achieve the
same intended change.

IMPORTANT: Context lines (prefixed with space) and deletion lines (prefixed with -) must match
the current document exactly. Always include complete lines and sufficient context (2-3 lines
before and after) to uniquely identify the location.

{% include 'format_spec.jinja2' %}
