The following str_replace commands failed to match the current document state.
The document has been partially modified by earlier commands. Please provide corrected commands
that will match the CURRENT document state shown below.

<current_document>
{{ current }}
</current_document>

<failed_commands>
{{ failed_commands }}
</failed_commands>

For each failed command, output a corrected str_replace command where the old_str
matches the CURRENT document (not the original). The new_str should achieve the
same intended change.

IMPORTANT: old_str must match EXACTLY in the current document - character for character,
including all whitespace. Each old_str must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the current document.
