## Output Format

Output a JSON object with a "commands" array:

{
  "commands": [
    {"command": "str_replace", "old_str": "exact text to find", "new_str": "replacement text"},
    {"command": "str_replace", "old_str": "another exact text", "new_str": "another replacement"}
  ]
}

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **EXACT MATCHING REQUIRED**: The `old_str` must match EXACTLY in the document - character for character, including all whitespace, indentation, and newlines.

2. **UNIQUENESS CONSTRAINT**: Each `old_str` must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the document. If it appears zero times or multiple times, the command will fail.

3. **Choose unique snippets**: Select text that is specific enough to appear only once. Include surrounding context lines if needed to make the match unique.

4. **For additions**: Include the line(s) before where you want to add content in `old_str`, then include those same lines PLUS the new content in `new_str`.

5. **For deletions**: Include the text to delete in `old_str`, and omit it from `new_str` (keeping surrounding context).

6. **Multiple changes**: Use separate commands for changes in different parts of the document. Commands are applied sequentially.
