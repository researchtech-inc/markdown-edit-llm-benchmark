# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Format Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The opening fence with language: ```markdown
2. The document name on the next line: document.md
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing document
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the document
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

# Critical Requirements:

- Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* existing document content, character for character
- SEARCH text is matched line-by-line. Always include COMPLETE lines - never start or end SEARCH mid-line
- Include enough lines to uniquely match each location (2-3 lines of context)
- Keep blocks concise - only include changing lines plus minimal context
- Multiple blocks can be used for multiple changes
- For additions: include surrounding lines in SEARCH, add new content in REPLACE
- For deletions: include text to delete in SEARCH, omit it from REPLACE

# Example:

```markdown
document.md
<<<<<<< SEARCH
## Introduction

This is the first paragraph.
=======
## Introduction

This is the first paragraph.

This is a new paragraph being added.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
