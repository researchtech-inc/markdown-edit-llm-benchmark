The following SEARCH/REPLACE blocks failed to match the current document state.
The document has been partially modified by earlier blocks. Please provide corrected blocks
that will match the CURRENT document state shown below.

<current_document>
{{ current }}
</current_document>

<failed_blocks>
{{ failed_blocks }}
</failed_blocks>

For each failed block, output a corrected SEARCH/REPLACE block where the SEARCH text
matches the CURRENT document (not the original). The REPLACE text should achieve the
same intended change.

IMPORTANT: SEARCH text is matched line-by-line. Always include COMPLETE lines in SEARCH.
Never start SEARCH in the middle of a paragraph - include the full line from its beginning.

{% include 'format_spec.jinja2' %}

Output only the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* in diff-fenced format:
