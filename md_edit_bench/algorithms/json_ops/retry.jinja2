The following operations failed to match the current document state.
The document has been partially modified by earlier operations. Please provide corrected operations
that will match the CURRENT document state shown below.

<current_document>
{{ current }}
</current_document>

<failed_operations>
{{ failed_operations }}
</failed_operations>

For each failed operation, output a corrected operation where the target.match text
matches the CURRENT document (not the original). The operation should achieve the
same intended change.

IMPORTANT: target.match must be copied verbatim from the current document and must be unique
within the target section.
