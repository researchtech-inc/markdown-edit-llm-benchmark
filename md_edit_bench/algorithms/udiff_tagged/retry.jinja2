The following hunks failed to match the current document state.
The document has been partially modified by earlier hunks. Please provide corrected hunks
that will match the CURRENT document state shown below.

<current_document>
{{ current }}
</current_document>

<failed_hunks>
{{ failed_hunks }}
</failed_hunks>

For each failed hunk, output a corrected hunk where the [CTX]/[DEL] lines match the CURRENT
document (not the original). The [ADD] lines should achieve the same intended change.

IMPORTANT: Include enough [CTX] lines to uniquely identify the location in the CURRENT document.
Always include COMPLETE lines - never start in the middle of a line.

{% include 'format_spec.jinja2' %}

Output only the corrected hunks as a tagged unified diff in a ```diff fenced code block.
