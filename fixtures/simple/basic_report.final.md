In terms of market positioning, we have solidified our place as a top-three provider in the enterprise segment, with strong brand recognition and customer satisfaction scores consistently above 4.5/5. Our competitive advantages in integration capabilities and customer support continue to differentiate us from both legacy providers and newer entrants in the market.
