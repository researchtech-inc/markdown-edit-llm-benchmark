## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

Database performance under load remains a concern. We will conduct load testing in Phase 3 to identify bottlenecks early.

Legacy system integration may require additional development time. A buffer of one week has been allocated for unexpected complications.

### Resource Risks

Team availability during holiday season could impact Week 11-12 timelines.
